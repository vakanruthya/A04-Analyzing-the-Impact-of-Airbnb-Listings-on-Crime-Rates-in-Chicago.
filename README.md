# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Airbnb-Listings-on-Crime-Rates-in-Chicago.
Introduction & Motivation
As we all know, crime is one of the most significant challenges facing the city of Chicago, and through our analysis, we aim to investigate its impact on Airbnb's business operations. It is quite plausible that a potential customer may feel uneasy or even deterred from booking accommodations located in neighborhoods where crime rates are high, as the possibility of encountering or witnessing criminal activity could create a sense of discomfort and insecurity. This hesitation can have a direct effect on Airbnb's overall bookings, particularly in areas with higher crime rates. Our goal is to shine a light on the challenges customers are experiencing when considering properties in such neighborhoods, where safety concerns may be the key factor causing them to hesitate in making a booking. By drawing attention to these crime-centric locations, we hope to encourage Airbnb to consider implementing additional safety protocols and measures that can instill greater confidence in potential guests. With enhanced safety measures in place, we believe both the customers’ sense of security and satisfaction will improve, leading to increased bookings, ultimately benefiting both Airbnb and the individual hosts. Moreover, by proactively addressing the issue of safety, Airbnb can foster a stronger relationship with its customer base, promoting trust and long-term loyalty. We want to ensure that Airbnb's reputation as a safe and reliable platform is not compromised by the negative perception of crime in certain neighborhoods.
Executive Summary
The study aims to explore how Airbnb listings might influence crime rates in different neighborhoods of Chicago. We investigate whether an increase in Airbnb listings correlates with changes in specific crime types and assesses how factors like property type, host responsiveness, and neighborhood characteristics interact with crime patterns. Using data sources: Airbnb Data and Chicago Crime Data. We use spatial analysis to map the density of Airbnb listings and overlay it with crime data across Chicago’s neighborhoods. We provide recommendations that policymakers should consider zoning regulations for Airbnb in neighborhoods with high crime rates to balance tourism growth with community safety, improve surveillance and preventive measures in areas with high Airbnb activity. While Airbnb listings contribute to economic activity, they may also influence crime dynamics in localized ways. The findings aim to help Airbnb make data-driven decisions about managing short-term rental growth while maintaining neighborhood safety.
